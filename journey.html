                        <p>Hello, human. Welcome to my learning blog! This website stands as a digital testament to my journey in mastering web development. Here, you'll discover a collection of projects that I've crafted while traversing The Frontend Developer Career Path at Scrimba.</p>

                        <p>Learning is not just a task; it's a journey that defines my everyday existence. To maintain my commitment, I rely on the simple yet powerful practice of setting both short and long-term goals. These goals serve as guiding lights, steering me through the ebbs and flows of my educational path, while also offering a sense of achievement as I progress. In my pursuit of knowledge, I've learned to appreciate the art of taking things slow but steady. Rushing through material may offer instant gratification, but it's the deliberate pace that ensures lasting comprehension and retention. And amidst it all, I find solace in daydreaming about the futureâ€”imagining the projects I'll undertake, the connections I'll forge, and the impact I'll make. These dreams fuel my passion, driving me to push boundaries, embrace challenges, and ultimately, fulfill my potential.</p>

                        <p>My journey into programming began with a chance encounter during a vacation in the Philippines. It was there that I met Mais, a self-taught engineer with a passion for travel. Our discussions about her transition from finance to tech sparked a realization within me. Inspired by her story and fueled by my fascination with programming, I made the decision to dive into web development seriously. This encounter served as the catalyst for my journey to transition successfully from the hotel industry to the world of technology. Reflecting on my high school days, where I first dabbled in programming courses, I realized that those early experiences had laid the foundation for my current path of learning and growth.</p>
